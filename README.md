# ðŸ¥¡ðŸ¤– SkFolia To God
 
This repo has automated, nightly builds of the Skript's [Folia Version]([https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/tree/feature/folia)) for Minecraft so that you don't have to build it yourself. 

These builds may or may not be up-to-date with the latest Skript Folia commits because they run at a certain time every day.

## Run It Locally

This method does not work with the Windows command prompt or PowerShell.

First, clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/binbinuser/SkFoliaToGo
```

Now go to its directory:
```sh
cd SkFoliaToGo
```

Then run the build script:
```sh
sh build.sh
```

## Support

I don't have any affiliation with Skript, Paper or Folia other than being a happy user of theirs. Therefore, I can't provide Skript support here. Check out the [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) page if you need support, though!
